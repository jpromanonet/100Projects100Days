# 100Projects100Days
The idea is to make 100 projects in a 100 days streak, making one project per day.

## Ground Rules

1. I must to commit one project per day.
2. It has to be a different project every day, no project could extend more than one day.
3. I upload a /dir with the name project in this same repo.

## Social media posting

I gonna be posting everyday for the extend of the challenge in Linkedin and Instagram.
